# image_autotaggers

Code and sample images to run through automatic image tagging services. Python code for 3.5+. 

This repo accompanies a computer vision for social scientists workshop. It currently includes sample scripts to run images through Amazon's Rekognition service. Steps to set up an AWS account and get keys for the Rekognition API are available HERE. 

Check your ethics and reserach guidelines before using any autotagger server. AWS and other services will likely have the option under their Terms of Service to retain any images you run through the tagger and any generated labels. **BE AWARE OF THIS IF YOU HAVE PRIVACY CONCERNS ABOUT YOUR IMAGES.** Note, too, that there are recognized biases in this autotaggers.
